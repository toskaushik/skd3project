          NSSP is a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments and academic and private sector partners to collect, analyze and share electronic patient encounter data received from multiple healthcare settings. 
          <br/>
          
          To track trends of potential COVID-19 visits, visits for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) (fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code) and ILI to a subset of emergency departments in 47 states are being monitored.

          Nationwide during week 29, 3.5% of emergency department visits captured in NSSP were due to CLI and 1.0% were due to ILI(Influenza like symptoms). In comparison to week 28, this week there was a decrease in the percentage of visits for both CLI and ILI. However, the percentage of visits for CLI increased from week 23 through week 28, and trends presented this week may change as more ED visit data are received.
          <br/>
         
          Recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine,
recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased
practice of social distancing, are likely affecting data reported from both networks, making it
difficult to draw conclusions at this time. Tracking these systems moving forward will give
additional insight into illness related to COVID-19.
