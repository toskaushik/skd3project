                The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic,
                is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
                (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
                coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).The outbreak was first identified in
                December 2019 in Wuhan, China.The World Health Organization
                declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International
                Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 26
                July 2020, more than 16.1 million cases of COVID‑19 have been
                reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting
                in more than 645,000 deaths; more than 9.28 million people have
                recovered.
                <br />
                <br />
                The virus is primarily spread between people during close
                contact, most often via small droplets produced by
                coughing,sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the
                ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over
                long distances. Transmission may also occur through smaller
                droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer
                periods of time. Less commonly, people may become infected by
                touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It
                is most contagious during the first three days after the onset
                of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear,
                and from people who do not show symptoms.
                <br /><br />
                Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of
                breath, and loss of sense of smell. Complications may include
                pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.The time from
                exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but
                may range from two to fourteen days. There is no known vaccine
                or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is
                symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive
                measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when
                coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face
                mask in public settings, disinfecting surfaces, increasing
                ventilation and air filtration indoors, and monitoring and
                self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
                Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel
                restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility
                closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing
                capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.

              More than 4,163,892 people in the United States have been infected
              with the coronavirus and at least 145,982 have died, according to
              the CDC database. The number of new, confirmed cases across the
              country has been at least 50,000 per day for most of the last
              three weeks, as the virus surges in hot spots across the southern
              and western United States.
